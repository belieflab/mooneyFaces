# mooneyFaces

The Mooney Faces Task presents a randomized array of 48 images with a break in between.

The Silverstein version adds 2 rating judgements for whether a face appears to be an adult / child and whether a face appears to be more masculine or feminine.

The Silverstein version also adds 10 inverted and 10 upright catch images which should never be construed as a face.

The total administration time should last no longer than 15 minutes.
